# BookStore_Website

I developed a responsive cosy bookstore website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean and inviting design with a creative, floral-inspired touch. The website includes interactive book sliders, curated sections for featured books, and smooth transitions that enhance the browsing experience. Inspired by the charm of independent bookstores, this project blends elegance and usability, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience across all devices.
